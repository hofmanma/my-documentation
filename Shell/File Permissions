ls -l demo.txt

Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 31 05:48 demo.txt

// In this example change file ownership to hofmanma user and list the permissions, run:
chown hofmanma demo.txt
ls -l demo.txt

// chown shifts the ownership to another user.
// The ownership is taken away from the old owners. They don't have access any more.
