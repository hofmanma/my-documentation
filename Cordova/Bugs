Apache Cordova: iOS click event not working – Quick „how to“
When you are using Apache Cordova to create apps, you will most likely use click  events to navigate from one view to another or to do other stuff.

This all works fine on Android devices, but iOS is not doing anything – and you won’t get an error in the debug console, either.

The problem is that iOS is not sending a click  event, but touchstart .
/////////////////////////
// Sample
So your event listener should look somewhat like the following:

$('button').on('click touchstart', function(){
    // Click event - even working with iOS
});
